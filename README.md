# Network Fundamental Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP) Set Up (Cisco Packet Tracer - For study purpose only)
Here in this project i will configure a Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP) architecture. These designs can be expanded to create very complex architectures depending on the network requirements.

##Configuration List
1. HSRP
2. STP Root Bridge
3. VTP
4. ACL
5. DHCP
6. Custom Website & DNS Service

## How to Run
Install [Cisco Packet Tracer](https://www.netacad.com/courses/packet-tracer) and then simply open the [HSRP.pkt](https://github.com/weixiong15/Network_Fundamental_HSRP/blob/master/HSRP.pkt). The whole network is in working condition. You can check it by sending a packet from one system to another or through using the PING command in the Cisco Packet Tracer.

**All Router and Switch passwords: cisco**

This solution works for version 6.2 or above of Cisco Packet Tracer.
